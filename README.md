# Question-Card

This is a collection of bank routing info for "pre-paid" credit cards, often used in scams.

The main idea is that these route numbers can be scanned for in incoming emails, and raise an alert of a possible scam.

**This repo/collection/info/code/author/etc in no way is insinuating anything negative about the banks/cards, nor users of such cards.   These cards are often used in scams, thus raising attention to them.**

Have any to add?  twitter.com/violentlydave

All the routing numbers are contained in "routinginfo.sh" .. why in a .sh?  Because I'm weird, and like having things in formats like this so I can do things with them later.
